2.Outline Of The Project
==================

* **2.1 Product Description**
By developing mobile terminal application, biologists can help quickly analyze gene files, reduce their workload and improve work efficiency.
* **2.2 Product Function**
Analyzing the gene expression file uploaded by the user, extracting information from the valid gene file. After processing and analyzing the data, the application will quickly feedback the gene expression table and scatter plots that biologists need. In scatter plot, up-regulated genes is represented by red dot, and down-regulated genes is represented by blue dot.

* **2.3 User Characteristics**
The ultimate user of this software is a biological scientist. The user community generally has higher education, and has strong learning and adaptability. They can quickly adapt to the application and fully feel the change of the work efficiency .Then put forward reasonable suggestions for improvement.

* **2.4 General Constraints**
The constraints of the development of the application are: 
(1) The methods and techniques adopted are limited: the technical level of the project team members is not mature enough, so they need to learn a variety of technologies and capabilities in the process of development. 

* **2.5 Hypothesis And Basis**
The successful implementation of the project depends mainly on the following conditions:
(1) Team members actively cooperate and cooperate. For the development and implementation of the project, we should make reasonable plans for personal time. At the same time, make reasonable sacrifice for the team and cooperate with teammates to complete the task.

(2)Biologists provide complete and detailed information on function and performance requirements, so that the team can analyze them and form a complete software requirement.
